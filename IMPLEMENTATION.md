# Nota AI v1.1 Implementation Report

## Features Implemented

### 1. Complete English Localization

- Created YAML-based localization system in `app/i18n/`
- Added translation helper function: `t(key, lang)`
- Replaced all UI strings with localized versions
- Added welcome message for new users
- Implemented text_en.yaml with all UI strings

### 2. Unrecognized Article → Inline Suggestions

- Added `AwaitPickName` state in the FSM
- Implemented `fuzzy_find` function with 75% threshold in `matcher.py`
- Created `name_picker.py` handler for callback processing
- Integrated fuzzy suggestions into main edit flow
- Showing up to 2 inline matches for unrecognized items

### 3. Automatic Photo Preprocessing before GPT-4o OCR

- Created `imgprep/` module with preprocessing pipeline
- Implemented size limiting (2MB or 1600px max dimension)
- Added document detection and perspective correction
- Added CLAHE with adaptive clip limit and denoising
- Implemented adaptive thresholding and image improvement
- Integrated with OCR flow to use processed images

### 4. Multi-edit "Through Comma"

- Updated assistant system prompt to support multi-command parsing
- Enhanced `parse_edit_command` function to handle command separation
- Added support for comma, semicolon, and period-separated commands
- Added examples in documentation showing combined commands

### 5. Syrve Integration

- Created `syrve_client.py` with authentication and invoice submission
- Added prompt for XML generation in `assistants/prompts/syrve.md`
- Implemented token caching in Redis with 45-minute TTL
- Added error handling and retry logic
- Created handler for the "Confirm Invoice" button

### 6. Cleanup of Temporary Files

- Added cron job for cleaning files older than 1 day
- Set Redis TTL for thread_id keys to 10 minutes
- Created proper cleanup script in infra/cron/

### 7. Dashboard and Metrics

- Added Prometheus metrics in `app/utils/monitor.py`
- Implemented counters for invoice processing
- Added latency histograms for various processing stages
- Created Grafana dashboard for monitoring the system
- Added dashboard JSON to `infra/grafana/dashboards/nota.json`

## Implementation Notes

### Translation System

The translation system uses a simple key-lookup pattern with nested keys (dot notation). 
Example: `t("button.confirm", lang="en")` → "✅ Confirm"

This allows for easy extension to other languages by creating additional YAML files.

### Fuzzy Matching

The fuzzy matching system uses a similarity threshold of 75% and returns up to 2 best matches.
When matches are found, an inline keyboard is shown to the user for quick selection.

### Image Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:
1. Size normalization
2. Document detection and perspective correction
3. Contrast enhancement with CLAHE
4. Noise reduction
5. Adaptive thresholding
6. Morphological operations
7. Sharpening

This significantly improves OCR quality for poor-quality photos.

### Multi-edit Commands

Commands can be separated by:
- Commas: `row 1 price 100, row 2 name Apple`
- Semicolons: `date 01.05.2025; row 3 qty 5`
- Periods: `add rice 2 kg 150. change supplier to ABC Corp`

### Syrve Integration

The integration follows this flow:
1. User clicks "Confirm Invoice"
2. System generates invoice XML using GPT-4o
3. SyrveClient authenticates and submits the invoice
4. Result is displayed to the user
5. Metrics are updated

### Metrics

Key metrics tracked:
- `nota_invoices_total{status}`
- `nota_ocr_latency_ms`
- `assistant_latency_ms{phase}`
- `fuzzy_suggestions`

These provide comprehensive monitoring of system performance and usage.
