# Cancel Button Fix: Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the fix to the "Cancel" button issue where the bot hangs after pressing the button.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure:

1. You have the bot token in the `.env` file
2. Redis server is running (if used by the bot)
3. You have Python 3.11+ installed
4. All dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Test Procedures

### Test 1: Basic Cancel Button Test

**Purpose:** Verify basic cancel button functionality works without hanging.

**Steps:**
1. Start the bot in debug mode: `./start_bot_debugged.sh`
2. Send a photo to the bot
3. Wait for processing to begin and the cancel button to appear
4. Press the "Cancel" button
5. Verify the bot responds immediately (within 1-2 seconds) with a cancellation message
6. Verify the bot remains responsive after cancellation

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Telegram should not show a prolonged loading indicator
- ✅ The bot should respond with a cancellation message
- ✅ The keyboard should be removed
- ✅ The bot should return to a ready state for the next command

### Test 2: Concurrent Operation Test

**Purpose:** Test the cancel button during heavy processing to ensure it works under load.

**Steps:**
1. Start the bot in debug mode: `./start_bot_debugged.sh`
2. Send a large or complex image that will require significant processing
3. Press the "Cancel" button while processing is still ongoing
4. Immediately send another command to verify responsiveness

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Cancel operation works even during heavy processing
- ✅ The bot remains responsive to subsequent commands
- ✅ The thread pool should clean up properly without memory leaks

### Test 3: Rapid Cancel Test

**Purpose:** Test the cancel button's resilience to rapid, multiple cancel requests.

**Steps:**
1. Start the bot in debug mode: `./start_bot_debugged.sh`
2. Send a photo to the bot
3. Quickly press the "Cancel" button multiple times in succession
4. Observe bot behavior

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ The bot should handle multiple cancel requests gracefully
- ✅ No errors or hanging should occur
- ✅ Only one cancellation message should be sent (or the extras should be handled gracefully)

### Test 4: State Recovery Test

**Purpose:** Verify the bot properly resets its state after cancellation.

**Steps:**
1. Start the bot in debug mode: `./start_bot_debugged.sh`
2. Send a photo to the bot and start processing
3. Press "Cancel" to interrupt processing
4. Send a new photo immediately afterward
5. Verify the new photo is processed correctly without artifacts from the previous session

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ The bot should process the new photo correctly
- ✅ No state contamination from the cancelled session should occur
- ✅ All normal functionality should work after cancellation

### Test 5: Automated Test

**Purpose:** Automatically test the cancel button response time and functionality.

**Steps:**
1. Run the test script: `./test_cancel_button.py`
2. Follow instructions to press the cancel button
3. Check results for proper response

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ The automated test should complete without errors
- ✅ The cancel button should respond quickly
- ✅ All monitored metrics should be within acceptable ranges

## Monitoring and Debugging

For advanced monitoring and troubleshooting:

1. Run the monitoring script: `./cancel_button_monitor.py`
2. Use `/test` command in the monitor bot to generate test cancel buttons
3. Observe the detailed logs and response times
4. Check `cancel_button_monitor.log` for detailed operation logs

## Log Analysis

After testing, analyze the logs in `logs/` directory for:

1. Error messages
2. Warning messages
3. Unexpected behavior
4. Response time anomalies
5. Thread pool operations

## Additional Verification

- Check Redis for any orphaned thread pool entries
- Verify memory usage remains stable during repeated cancel operations
- Test under different network conditions

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check for concurrent handler conflicts
2. Verify the callback is being answered immediately
3. Check for blocking operations in the cancel handler
4. Verify proper cleanup of thread pool resources
5. Look for deadlocks between async operations
