# Changes Made to Fix Telegram Bot Issues

## 2023-11-25
- **[FIX]** Исправлена обработка фотографий с использованием OCR: теперь если OPENAI_OCR_KEY не установлен, бот автоматически использует OPENAI_API_KEY

## Issue 1: Bot Not Processing Photos Correctly

- Fixed the handler registration order in `bot.py` to ensure the photo handler is registered before the fallback handler
- Added content type filtering to the fallback handler to prevent it from intercepting photo messages:
  ```python
  # Register fallback handler AFTER all other handlers,
  # and ONLY for text messages, so it doesn't intercept photos
  dp.message.register(text_fallback, F.content_type == 'text')
  ```

## Issue 2: Multiple Bot Instances Causing Conflicts

- Created `check_and_restart.py` script to properly manage bot instances
- This script:
  1. Checks for existing bot processes and terminates them
  2. Resets webhook to prevent conflicts
  3. Starts the bot with force-restart flag
- Updated `run_bot.sh` to use this script for bot management

## Issue 3: Cancel Button Causing Bot Hang and Unresponsiveness

- Fixed critical issue with cancel button handler in `bot.py`:
  1. Now properly sets state to `NotaStates.main_menu` instead of clearing all state
  2. State changes now happen before any potential network operations
  3. Improved error handling with fallback mechanisms
  4. Pre-loads imports to prevent runtime import delays
  
- Removed conflicting cancel handler in `app/handlers.py` to prevent race conditions:
  1. Now only the handler in `bot.py` processes the "cancel:all" callback
  2. This eliminates the state management conflict between the two handlers

## Environment Configuration

- Verified correct environment variables in `.env` file:
  - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
  - OPENAI_OCR_KEY
  - SYRVE_SERVER_URL and related credentials

## Additional Performance Improvements

- Optimized imports to reduce runtime loading delays
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added proper cleanup of resources during shutdown
- Reorganized code to optimize bot startup time

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the bot using the run_bot.sh script:
   ```
   ./run_bot.sh
   ```

2. Verify that the bot correctly processes photos:
   - Send a photo to the bot
   - Bot should process it rather than respond with fallback message

3. Verify cancel button functionality:
   - Send a photo to the bot
   - Press cancel during processing
   - Confirm the bot responds immediately and is still responsive afterward
   - Send another photo to verify the bot can continue working

## Known Limitations

- The bot still needs to be restarted if multiple instances try to use the same token simultaneously
- This is a limitation of Telegram's API, but our check_and_restart.py script helps mitigate this
